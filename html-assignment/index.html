        </header>
            <p>Hi, my name is Maryam, but I prefer to be called <em>Maya</em>. I'm 25 years old and my birthday is on December 10<sup>th</sup>. I got married 3 years ago and moved here with my husband 6 month ago to build a better future for ourselves. Since moving to Canada and starting my studies at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>, I have had a great journey. </p>
            <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Architecture, and during my studies, I realized that I enjoy the art and design side of architecture the most. Therefore, I decided to attend this program, which has a lot of design. Although I have no experience with coding and building websites, I'm genuinely passionate about learning it. </p>
